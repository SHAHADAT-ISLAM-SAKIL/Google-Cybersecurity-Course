## 1️⃣ What is a Network?

A **network** is a system where multiple devices communicate and exchange data.

* Data is sent as **packets**
* A packet contains:

  * **Source** (who sends)
  * **Destination** (who receives)
  * **Data (body)**

---

## 2️⃣ Network Devices (Core Components)

Devices that control, forward, and secure network traffic.

### 🔹 Common Network Devices

* **Router** – Connects different networks (Layer 3)
* **Switch** – Connects devices inside a LAN (Layer 2)
* **Firewall** – Filters traffic (security gate)
* **Server** – Provides services to clients
* **Modem** – Connects ISP to internal network
* **Wireless Access Point (WAP)** – Provides Wi‑Fi

### 🔹 End Devices

* Computer, Laptop, Mobile, Tablet
* Each device has:

  * **MAC Address** (hardware ID)
  * **IP Address** (network ID)
  * **NIC** (Network Interface Card)

---

## 3️⃣ Firewall

Firewall is the **first line of defense** in a network.

### What it does:

* Inspects incoming & outgoing traffic
* Blocks suspicious or unauthorized traffic

📍 Usually placed between **internal network & internet**

> Firewall ≠ only defense, but a critical one
